# Sprint 2 &ndash; Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

## Starts Wednesday, 9/30
## Deliverables and quiz are due on Wednesday, 10/14

## Overview and Goals

Our second sprint will focus on some important concepts that you may have seen in a previous statistics class:

- The Normal distribution.
- The Central Limit Theorem.
- Sampling from a population.
- Constructing confidence intervals to estimate the mean of a population from a sample.
- Performing one-sample and two-independent-sample t-tests for hypotheses.
- Along the way, we'll review some important concepts related to inferential statistics, like the statistical significance and p-values.

Like the last sprint, you'll have four things to complete:

1. The deliverables described in this project.
2. An individual quiz.
3. A short individual reflective write-up.
4. Questions from the online ZyBook.

## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the project described in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project.

The quiz and reflective write-up will be done **online** on **Wednesday, October 14**, which will also be the release day for the next sprint's material. The quiz will be 
**individual** (not team) but will be **open everything**: you can use the sprint resources, your notes, and online resources. Remember to abide by the Honor Code 
and ask me if you have questions about what is an acceptable resource!

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapter 5 of the ZyBook. You do not need to complete the challenge questions or any sections marked as optional.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this sprint, you will be able to

- Reason about normally distributed data and describe situations where the normal distribution is likely to occur.

- State the Central Limit Theorem and explain why it is important for inferential statistics.

- Use appropriate R functions to construct confidence intervals for a population mean and interpret the results.

- Formulate a hypothesis for a one-sample t-test or a test of two independent sample means. Use the relevant R functions to perform the t-test and
interpret the results. Give correct interpretations of p-values and statistical significance.


## What You Need to Learn

1. The Normal distribution and the 69-95-99.7 empirical rule.

2. Calculating z-scores for members of a population given the population mean and standard deviation.

3. The simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling strategies.

4. Calculating a confidence interval for a population mean from a sample.

5. Formulating a hypothesis test that compares the mean of a sample to a predicted population mean.

6. Using the t-test to evaluate a hypothesis, including the concepts of p-values and the interpretation of the standard .05 rule for statistical significance.

7. Formulating and carrying out tests for the equality of the means of two independent samples.

## Resources

As in the previous unit, we'll spend time working through the labs in the `Examples` directory. Each lab will present a key concept along with its
application to a real dataset in R. Everything that you need to complete the homework project is covered in the labs.

## Tips

- **Don't wait until the last minute**! You won't have time to finish everything if you don't start promptly.

- The lab documents are important resources. Review them and use them as references when completing the homework projects.

- Remember that you're allowed to work with members of your team and use any other web resources you find useful.
