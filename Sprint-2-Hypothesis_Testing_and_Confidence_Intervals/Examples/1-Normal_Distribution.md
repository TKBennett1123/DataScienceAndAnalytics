## Introduction

Of all the statistical distributions, perhaps none is more iconic than the Normal distribution. Even people who have never taken a statistics class may recognize the famous “bell shaped” curve and have a pretty good intuitive idea what it means. When a variable has a Normal distribution, most observations are right around the mean and a few (in equal numbers) are much higher or much lower.

One of the goals of statistics is to identify and investigate both the “usual” and “unusual” in the world. In order to know if someone’s blood pressure is too high, we must first have a notion of what “normal” blood pressure is. In order to know if a part in a jet engine is unsafe, we first have to have to understand the “typical” failure rate of that part.   

When a variable does fit a Normal model, it gives us a powerful tool to describe what is usual and unusual for that variable. The mean (because it is equal to both the median and mode) is a good descriptor of a “typical” or “usual” value for the variable. The standard deviation is a ruler we can use to measure how “near” or “far” an observation is from the mean. This provides a standard method for determining when we’ve moved from the realm of the expected to the realm of the unexpected.

Later on, when we study statistical inference, the mathematical properties of the Normal model will allow us to assign a value of how likely or unlikely we believe an event to be based on our preconceived notion of “usual”. For now, we’ll look at describing and displaying data that has a Normal distribution and begin to develop an intuitive idea of how it can be used to discriminate between the expected and unexpected. For clarity, we will use “normal” as a synonym for “usual” or “typical” and “Normal” when referring specifically to the Normal Distribution.

## Guided Project: Determine the Speed of Light in Air

The speed of light is an important physical constant in physics and astronomy. Although it was determined as early as the 1600s that light traveled with a speed (as opposed to instantaneously), the exact speed had still not been measured in the late 19th century.

Building on the work of others, Albert A. Michaelson conducted a series of experiments using a device with a complicated system of lenses and revolving mirrors, and in June and early July 1879, he obtained 100 measurements of the speed of light. His results were first published in a report to the United States Secretary of the Navy.

We wish to use Michaelson’s original data, found in the `Michaelson.xlsx` dataset, to estimate the speed of light in air and compare it to the true speed of light in air, which was later determined to be 299,700 km/s.

Project deliverables:

1.	Import the `Michaelson.xlsx` dataset into R-Studio. Use the data dictionary to identify each variable in the dataset as categorical or quantitative. If the variable is categorical, further identify it as ordinal, nominal or an identifier variable. If the variable is quantitative, identify it as discrete or continuous.

2.	Draw a histogram displaying the distribution of measurements of the speed of light in air produced by Michaelson’s apparatus. Does a Normal model seem to fit this data?

3.	Draw a boxplot displaying the distribution of the measurements of the speed of light in air produced by Michaelson’s apparatus. 

4.	Describe the distribution of the measurement of the speed of light produced during Michaelson’s experiments.

5.	Use the 68-95-99.7% rule to determine the range of the middle 95% of measures of the speed of light we would expect to be generated by Michaelson’s apparatus.

6.	Calculate a z-score for the true speed of light in air (299,700 km/s) using the mean and standard deviation generated by Michaelson’s experiments.

7.	What proportion of the time would we expect Michaelson to have measured a value of the speed of light that is greater than the true value (299,700 km/s)?

8.	Draw conclusions about Michaelson’s experimental results and what we now know to be the true speed of light in air.

### Deliverable 1: Import the `Michaelson.xlsx` dataset into R-Studio. Use the data dictionary to identify each variable in the dataset as categorical or quantitative. If the variable is categorical, further identify it as ordinal, nominal or an identifier variable. If the variable is quantitative, identify it as discrete or continuous.

Using the methods we learned in Chapter 1, import the `Michaelson.xlsx` dataset.  Also open the file “Michaelson Data Dictionary” and an R Script. The first variable is ID, which is a categorical identifier variable that identifies each of Michaelson’s observations uniquely. The second variable is speedoflight. This is a continuous, quantitative measure of speed of light through air measured in kilometers per second.

### Deliverable 2: Draw a histogram displaying the distribution of Michaelson’s measurements of the speed of light in air. Does a Normal model seem to fit this data?

Type and run the following histogram function in an R Script to create Figure 4.1 

```
hist(
    x = Michaelson$speedoflight,
    main = "Measurements of the Speed of Light in Air", 
    xlab = "Speed of Light in km per sec",
    ylim = c(0,30)
)
```

The distribution is unimodal and symmetric with two possible outliers – one on the left side of the distribution and one on the right. A Normal model seems to fit this data.

### Deliverable 3: Draw a boxplot displaying the distribution of measurements of the speed of light in air produced by Michaelson’s apparatus. 


Type and run the following boxplot() function in an R Script to create Figure 4.2 

```
boxplot(
    x = Michaelson$speedoflight,
    main = "Measurements of the Speed of Light in Air", 
    xlab = "Speed of Light in km per sec",
    horizontal = TRUE
)
```

The boxplot confirms our description of the data in Deliverable 2. The distribution appears to be symmetric with two outliers on the left side and one on the right. A review of the original publication confirms these data to be valid experimental results.

### Deliverable 4: Describe the distribution of the measurement of the speed of light produced during Michaelson’s experiments.


Because the distribution of speedoflight is unimodal and symmetric, the mean and standard deviation are the best summary measures of the center and spread of the data. Type and run the following functions in an R Script to calculate the mean and SD of the experimental measures of the speed of light, which will produce the results below: 

```
> mean.speedoflight <- mean(Michaelson$speedoflight)
> mean.speedoflight
[1] 299852.4

> sd.speedoflight <- sd(Michaelson$speedoflight)
> sd.speedoflight
[1] 79.01055
```

The distribution of measures of the speed of light generated by Michaelson’s apparatus appears to be Normal with a mean of 299,852.4 km/sec and a standard deviation of 79 km/sec.

### Deliverable 5: Use the 68-96-99.7% rule to determine the range of the middle 95% of measures of the speed of light we would expect to be generated by Michaelson’s apparatus.

The 68-96-99.7% rule tells us that, for a variable with a Normal distribution, the middle 95% of the data will be within two standard deviations of the mean. Type and run the following functions in an R Script to find the range of the mean value of the speed of light plus and minus two standard deviations.

```
> mean.speedoflight - 2 * sd.speedoflight
[1] 299694.4

> mean.speedoflight + 2 * sd.speedoflight
 [1] 300010.4
 ```

The middle 95% of measurements of the speed of light in air generated by Michaelson’s apparatus are expected to be between about 299,650 km/sec and 300,000 km/sec.

### Deliverable 6: Calculate a z-score for the true speed of light in air (299,700 km/s) using the mean and standard deviation generated by Michaelson’s experiments.

Type and run the following function in an R Script to find a z-score for the true speed of light in air (299,700 km/s). To calculate the z-score, we subtract the mean of the experimental values from the true speed of light and divide by the standard deviation of the experimental data.

```
> (299700-mean.speedoflight)/sd.speedoflight
[1] -1.928856
```

The z-score for the true speed of light in air is -1.93. The true speed of light is 1.93 standard deviations below the mean generated by Michaelson’s experiments.

### Deliverable 7: What proportion of the time would we expect Michaelson to have measured a value of the speed of light in air that is greater than the true speed of light in air (299,700 km/s).

The `pnorm` function allows us to find the proportion of the data in a Normal model that we would expect to be larger or smaller than a particular value. Type and run the following function in an R Script to calculate the proportion of time Michaelson’s apparatus would be expected to overestimate the speed of light.

```
> pnorm(
	    299700, 
	    mean = mean.speedoflight, 
	    sd = sd.speedoflight, 
	    lower.tail = FALSE
	)
[1] 0.9731257
```

The first number entered in the pnorm function is the value of interest (in this case the true speed of light in air, 299,700 km/s). The argument `mean` is assigned the sample mean, `mean.speedoflight`, and the argument `sd` is assigned the sample standard deviation, `sd.speedoflight`.

By default, the `pnorm` function returns the proportion of data we expect to fall to the **left** of the value of interest. However, in this case we want to find the proportion of the time we expect the apparatus to generate a value of the speed of light greater than the true value, so we add the statement `lower.tail=FALSE`.

Michaelson’s apparatus would be expected to generate an estimate of the speed of light that is greater than the true speed of light about 97% of the time.

### Deliverable 8: Draw conclusions about Michaelson’s experimental results and what we now know to be the true speed of light in air.

Michaelson’s apparatus generated measurements of the speed of light in air that can be modeled by a Normal distribution with a mean of 299,852.4 km/s and a standard deviation of 79 km/s. In comparison, using modern methods, we are able to measure the speed of light in air as 299,700 km/s. The true speed of light in air is about two standard deviations below the mean estimated using Michaelson’s experiments. His apparatus would be expected to overestimate the speed of light about 97% of the time.
