## Starts Wednesday, 10/28
## Deliverables and quiz are due on Wednesday, 11/11

## Overview and Goals

We've spent the first half of the class covering several important concepts from statistical modeling: distributions, hypothesis tests, and simple and mutiple linear regression.
We're now going to transition to the main topic that will occupy us for the rest of the semester: **classification**. The techniques we're going to study all belong to the
field of **machine learning**, which is the study of algorithms that can automatically learn predictive models from example data.

This unit will cover:

- The concept of **classification** (also called "supervised learning" or "predicitve modeling") and examples of useful classification model.

- The use **training and testing sets** in the construction of classification models and the problem of **overfitting** a model.

- Our first two predictive modeling techniques: **K-Nearest Neighbors** and **logistic regression**.

- An overview of **K-means** the most popular algorithm for exploratory **clustering** analysis (also called "unsupervised learning"). This will also let us touch briefly
on Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which we mentioned, but did not cover in the material for the last unit.

By the end of this unit, you will have a good command of the core concepts of supervised machine learning. We'll continue to introduce more techniques in the last two units 
of the course.

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapter 10 of the Zybook on Data Mining. Note that we're skipping chapters seven, eight, and nine.

## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the problems in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project. **Please list the names of you collaborators in the project document**.

The quiz and reflective write-up will be done **online** on **Wednesday, November 11**, which will also be the release day for the next sprint's material. The quiz will be 
**individual** (not team) but will be **open everything**: you can use the sprint resources, your notes, and online resources. Remember to abide by the Honor Code 
and ask me if you have questions about what is an acceptable resource!

**Remember that you have only two weeks to complete this sprint, so don't procrastinate!**

## Submission Instructions

Upload one document (Word or PDF) containing all of your answers to the sprint questions. Please remember to include:

- Answers to every part of every question.

- Your code.

- Any plots that you need to create to answer each question.


## Resources

The `Examples` directory contains R scripts that will help you complete the Deliverable problems. As before, we'll go over these together in class.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwVg9jCtqaU) from Google gives a high-level overview of machine learning and supervised learning.

For background information on data mining, beyond the ZyBook, I recommend [these notes and slides](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php) for the book
*Introduction to Data Mining* by Tan et al.

- Start with the slides for Chapter 3, although they quickly get into decision trees (we'll talk about those in the next unit).

- You can then look at the slides for KNN (Chapter 4) and basic clustering (Chapter 7).

For a visual explanation of k-means, I like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXXa-CAoS0).
